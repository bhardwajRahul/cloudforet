## Reporting a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Cloudforet Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

You can email the private security@cloudforet.io list with the security details.

## When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

* You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Cloudforet
* You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Cloudforet
* You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Cloudforet depends on
* For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there
